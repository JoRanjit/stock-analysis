# Overview of Project:

## This project analyzes the performance trends of 12 stocks across years

##### The tool takes into consideration several factors throughtout the year like
		* Starting Price of the stocks	
		* Ending Price of the stocks
		* Trading volume
	
	
##### Based on the analysis of the above metrics, the tool shares a comprehensive view of the stock's performance
	
	
###### Results -2017
	 All 12 stockes except one had a promising year in 2017:
		* 4 stocks gave more than 100% returns
		* Stock 'DQ' gave almost 200% returns
		* Stock 'TERP' had a bad year, and was down by 7.2%
		
	
###### Results -2018
	2018 was a bad year for alomost all stocks
		* only 2 stocks returned a profit
		* Stocks 'ENPH' and 'RUN' relatively performed better, but did not give a 100% return
		

#### Refactoring code: 


###### Advantages
	* The code is cleaner and easier to understand
	* Code also runs faster
	* It is also easier to debug as it is compact

###### Disadvantages
	* Takes longer to write the code
	* Can be complex to enable the code to handle all possibilities
	* The code should be efficient enough to handle errors generated 
	

#### pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
	* The original VBA script had all the necessary steps involved to generate the expected results
	* This made refactoring easy as we had to just apply the array logic which made the code cleaner and quicker
	* 'All Stocks Analysis' macro took about 0.9 sec to run, while the refactored 'VBA_Challenge' code ran in 0.2 sec.
